# Dotfiles
Contains dotfiles, other configuration and everything else I want to backup and sync between machines for a reproducable development environment
Mostly stuff for bash ( .bashrc, bash scripts and functions ), Neovim, tmux and git. But any software I regurlarly use and need to configure, I will prolly had to this repo.

# TODO
* [ ] **TESTS**: My goal is to be able to install and configure everything I need on a fresh Linux installation. I'm looking into Vagrant and QEMU/VM to see how to automate this. As I have GUI/Desktop stuff, I don't think Docker will work for what I want.  
* [ ] **INSTALLATION SCRIPT**: Split the configuration between CLI only VS Desktop installation. I want to use this repo to clone my config on a server potentially, even shared. I should be able to install all my configuration in the home folder. But also have the choice to install everything globally and install fonts and other GUI programs
* [ ] **APT packages**: Need to add the list of packages I use / need.
